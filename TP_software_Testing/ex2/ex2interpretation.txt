In Exercise 2, I applied Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) to the temperature 
regulator.
The specification defines a tolerance zone of ±0.5°C around the target 
temperature.
I therefore identified the two critical boundaries: target – 0.5 and 
target + 0.5.

I designed a complete set of test cases covering values just below, at, 
and just above these boundaries.
The goal was to verify that the regulator transitions correctly between 
the HEAT, COOL, and STANDBY states.

After running the tests, all assertions passed successfully, confirming 
that the implementation behaves as expected.
No defect was detected within the tested boundary range.
